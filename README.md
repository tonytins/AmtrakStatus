# Amtrak Status Boards

Amtrak Status Boards, or AMTK Status, is a desktop front-end for accessing Dixieland Software's [station status boards](https://dixielandsoftware.net/Amtrak/solari/). 

## Background

This was intended to solve a rather awkward dilemma. While I much prefer PWAs, I used to have a bunch of standalone web apps for stations that I view on Virtual Railfan. This front-end was intended to solve that dilemma byÂ accessing all stations from a single application using a modern, cleaner interface.
