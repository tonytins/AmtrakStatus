Amtrak Status Boards, or AMTK Status, is a desktop front-end for accessing Dixieland Software's [station status boards](https://dixielandsoftware.net/Amtrak/solari/). 

**WARNING: LARGE RESOLUTION.**

## Background

This was intended to solve a rather awkward dilemma. I turned a bunch of online Amtrak status boards made by Dixieland Software into PWAs (standalone web apps) for stations that I viewed on Virtual Railfan. While it was convenient—don't get me wrong—I had to create a new web app for each station, and it became overwhelming to constantly switch between them all. This front-end was intended to solve that dilemma by accessing all stations from a single application using a modern, cleaner interface. The original icons found in this project's first commit were used for those PWAs.
