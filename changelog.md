- Clickable links that open the default broswer.

### Version sceheme change

Three digits in the version were moved from the patch to the minor section (i.e., `0.Y.100` to `0.100.Z`) due to the difference in ways of desktop applications are developed, which I never needed to account for until now. It was easier to get away with putting it in the patch for CLI tools and libraries because the core user experience never changed, despite frequent internal changes.
